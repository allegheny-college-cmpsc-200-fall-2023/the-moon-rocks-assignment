## classifier
Complete this work in [classifier/main.c](classifier/main.c).

Most folks would arrive on the moon and laze around in the lunar ocean a bit. Not us! We've been collecting rocks. Of course, you need to catalog them using a struct. Heck, we'll even send you out to collect _at least 1 more_ to test the system and see if it stands up to future development.

For this assignment, once you've completed the basic program, find [one more sample](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_rock) and create an entry in the data structure(s) which matches its `name`, `type`, `ID`, and `weight`. What you pick is up to you!

### Changes to files in `.vscode`

Based on your system setup (refer to your `hello-blinky` assignment), you will need switch out the `.vscode` folder in each exercise with the _last working copy_.

See our [wiki's entry  on "Configuring Assignments"](https://github.com/allegheny-college-cmpsc-200-fall-2023/course-materials/wiki/03-Configuring-Assignments)
