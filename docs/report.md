# The Moon Rocks: General report

This week's work introduced:

* more practice with data structures
* a new data structure called a `struct`
* additional experience with memory management via the `heap`
* other eccentricities of the `C` language

Respond to the following prompts about the programs illustrating these concepts.

## What is the average of all rocks whose type begin with a `B`?

`TODO`

## Describe the significance of boundary checking. Why does it matter so much?

> Hint: unlike Python, it doesn't have to do with _errors_, per se.

`TODO`

## Reflect on how you used string-like data in Assembly programs and compare it with what we've learned about the `char` type. How does our work in Assembly explain memory allocation for a `char`?

> Hint: helpful fact/hint -- each character occupies a single byte.

`TODO`

## We're starting to understand the relationship between our programs and the _heap_. Speculate: why is it advantageous to use the heap?

> Hint: how is it different from the _stack_?

`TODO`
